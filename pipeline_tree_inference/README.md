Pipeline for species tree inference
=============================================================

This directory contains all the scripts used to generate a species tree following the pipeline described in the manuscript. The input is a set of files (one per marker) containing the protein sequences of each marker across genomes.

Scripts are designed to run on an a slurm-based computer cluster, such as the [Sol](https://cores.research.asu.edu/research-computing/about) supercomputer at Arizona State University.
