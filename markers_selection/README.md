Markers selection from KEGG and EggNog gene families from WoL2 genomes and EMP MAGs
=========

This directory contains all the data and notebooks necesssary to select gene families as markers from the WoL2 genomes and EMP MAGs. Notebooks used to select 1,510 genomes from the ~16k WoL2 genomes and generate figures of functional description of markers and robustness of marker can be found here.
